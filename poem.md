# A message to the rainbows

Rainbow are desappeared from reality ?
I don't think they do, they are everywhere,
color are reflected everywhere just like:
you tooking at the sky which color is skyblue
and clouds which color is white ?, maybe when 
they're happy, gray when they are disgusting
but if there's one word I could use to describe
all this thing, I'd rather select `RAINBOW`.
